# February's Adventure | 404 Page: The Alien Bug

---

I've been dabbling in HTML/CSS, soaking up everything like a sponge, and honestly, still figuring out how to make my code not look like spaghetti.

## üåå Introduction

When Cod√©dex announced the 404 Page Challenge for February, my brain did that thing where it goes, "Hey, let's turn this usually annoying error page into something people might actually enjoy stumbling upon." So, here I am, throwing my hat in the ring with something I've poured my newbie passion into: An Alien Bug 404 Page.

### So, Why an Alien Bug?

Imagine this: You're cruising through the internet, minding your own business, and bam! You hit a 404. But instead of the usual "Page Not Found" snoozefest, you're greeted by this quirky alien bug. This little guy is my way of saying, "Yep, this page is as elusive as aliens themselves." It's about turning a dead-end into a pit stop for a quick smile or a chuckle.

I wanted to create a spot where the unexpected error becomes a brief moment of fun. It's a nod to all the explorers of the digital universe, reminding us that sometimes, getting lost is part of the adventure.

## üöÄ About The Project
